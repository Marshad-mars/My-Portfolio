This is one of my most prominent web-dev projects which is the biggest one i might be doing until future.
This project contains my first proper web dev portfolio which would be updatable time to time.
It is mainly divided into 4 different parts- Home-page, Projects-pages, Education-page and Experience-page. It is also availale at internet through vercel app.
Click on the link available at the side of the window(if availabe) Or just go to this domain- <sb-it.vercel.app>.
This project is mainly composed of HTML and CSS and other function languages would be included and modified in this project- further later.
There would not be seperate style sheet for all the other parts of the whole web site, except for the home-page index.html to make it distinctive it from all the other parts.

*Home-page is nothing but the root and also the main page of the whole website. Though there would not be any file named-> Home-page. All the other parts like projects-
    page and others are connected with the index.html only. <br>
*Projects-page contains my different different projects that i have made of different aspects. This repo would not contain any seperate style sheet. <br>
*Education-page contains my educational background. <br>
*Experience-page contains my experiences of all theses types of activities that i have done in git hub and learned.

This projects is heavily influenced by Apna College where i was learning by doing, so special thanks to them.
