                            <b>~This page which is a kind of web-site, is a portfolio which is my first portfolio on web-dev. Actually this was a task i found at "Apna-college". There i was
                                learning HTML which was a project, learning by doing. Later i was able to know this thing. I was building this for a long time and it took 
                                me a long time to complete this project. I thought that if i have build this so much then i may take a free host like vercel.com
                                and smash this in it so that people could see it, and i may make a new repo at github for this and consider it as my one of my 
                                web-dev projects. I was learning as well as make a huge thing like this which it was really exciting. My
                                special thanks to "Apna Apna-college" who have helped me so far! <br> And thank you for visiting my website and for reading it perfectly and also you may like this "web-site":)
